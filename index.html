         I love to talk about my hobby, painting, any chance I get. I believe painting is a wonderful talent to have. It is a skill for which talent is pre-requisite. You can learn how to hold a brush and which colours to mix. But true artistry is nothing without talent.<br></br> Painting is also calming, you can let the brush take over and guide you where it wants. Sometimes a Jackson Pollock painting makes sense to your brain, whereas sometimes you crave a nostalgic scenery done by Van Gogh. Painting can convey the depth and complexity of human consciousness which canâ€™t be conveyed through words.
